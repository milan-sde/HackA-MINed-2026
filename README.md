SmartContainer Risk Engine is an end-to-end AI/ML system that predicts risk levels for containerized cargo shipments and helps customs authorities prioritize physical inspections. It combines an XGBoost classifier, an Isolation Forest anomaly detector, and rule-based heuristics into a weighted ensemble model that scores every container on a 0–100 risk scale, categorizes it as **Critical**, **Low Risk**, or **Clear**, and generates a human-readable explanation for each prediction. A FastAPI backend serves these predictions to a React + TypeScript dashboard where customs officers can monitor container flow in real time, review AI explanations, flag containers for inspection, and manage an inspection workflow — all from a single interface.

## 1. Problem Statement

Global maritime trade moves over **800 million containers per year**. At any given port, thousands of containers arrive daily carrying goods of varying origin, value, and compliance risk. Customs authorities face a fundamental challenge: **they cannot physically inspect every container**, yet missing a high-risk shipment — whether it involves undervaluation, weight fraud, or prohibited goods — has serious economic and security consequences.

### Current Challenges

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **Volume overwhelm** | Ports process thousands of containers daily; manual review of each is impossible |
| **Static rule-based systems** | Traditional threshold rules (e.g., "flag all containers from country X") generate excessive false positives and miss novel fraud patterns |
| **Imbalanced risk distribution** | Only ~1% of containers are truly Critical, making detection a needle-in-a-haystack problem |
| **No behavioral profiling** | Legacy systems don't track exporter/importer risk histories or cross-reference shipment patterns |
| **Lack of explainability** | Officers receive a "flag" with no reasoning, making it difficult to prioritize or justify inspections |

### Why AI Is Needed

Customs authorities need a system that can:

- **Learn from historical inspection outcomes** to identify what makes a shipment suspicious
- **Detect anomalies** that rule-based systems miss (unusual weight-to-value ratios, off-hours declarations, dwell time spikes)
- **Rank containers by risk** so officers focus on the highest-priority shipments first
- **Explain its reasoning** so that flagging decisions are transparent and auditable
- **Operate in real time** to keep pace with container arrivals at the port

---

## 3. System Architecture

The system follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns between the frontend presentation layer, the backend API layer, and the ML inference engine.

![Architecture](assets/2_Architecture.png)

### Layer Responsibilities

| Layer | Technology | Responsibility |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| **Presentation** | React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Recharts, Zustand | Dashboard UI, charts, tables, modals, real-time updates |
| **API** | FastAPI, Uvicorn, Pydantic | REST endpoints, request validation, file I/O, CORS |
| **Inference** | XGBoost, scikit-learn, NumPy, pandas | Feature engineering, model loading, ensemble scoring, explanation generation |
| **Data** | CSV files, JSON files, joblib-serialized models | Training data, predictions, flagged containers, notes |

---

## 4. Data Pipeline

### Source Datasets

The system operates on two datasets representing the full lifecycle of container risk assessment:

| Dataset | Rows | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Historical Data** | 54,000 | Training, validation, and test data with known `Clearance_Status` labels |
| **Real-Time Data** | 8,481 | Unlabeled containers for live inference (simulates incoming shipments) |

### Container Record Schema

Each container record contains the following fields, representing a single customs declaration:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `Container_ID` | Integer | Unique identifier for the container |
| `Declaration_Date` | Date | Date the customs declaration was filed |
| `Declaration_Time` | Time | Time the declaration was filed |
| `Trade_Regime` | String | Import, Export, or Transit |
| `Origin_Country` | String | ISO country code of shipment origin |
| `Destination_Port` | String | Port of arrival |
| `Destination_Country` | String | ISO country code of destination |
| `HS_Code` | String | Harmonized System code classifying the goods |
| `Importer_ID` | String | Unique identifier for the importing entity |
| `Exporter_ID` | String | Unique identifier for the exporting entity |
| `Declared_Value` | Float | Value declared by the shipper (in currency units) |
| `Declared_Weight` | Float | Weight declared by the shipper (in kg) |
| `Measured_Weight` | Float | Actual weight measured at the port (in kg) |
| `Dwell_Time_Hours` | Float | Hours the container has been at the port |
| `Shipping_Line` | String | Carrier / shipping line identifier |
| `Clearance_Status` | String | **Target label** — Clear, Low Risk, or Critical (historical only) |

### Target Distribution (Historical Data)

The dataset exhibits **severe class imbalance**, which is realistic for customs data — most shipments are legitimate:

| Risk Level | Count | Percentage |
|------------|-------|------------|
| **Clear** | 42,347 | 78.4% |
| **Low Risk** | 11,108 | 20.6% |
| **Critical** | 545 | **1.0%** |

### Data Flow

![Architecture](assets/3_Dataflow.png)

### Data Splits

| Split | Rows | Clear | Critical | Low Risk |
|-------|------|-------|----------|----------|
| **Train** | 37,799 (70%) | 29,642 | 381 | 7,776 |
| **Validation** | 8,101 (15%) | 6,353 | 82 | 1,666 |
| **Test** | 8,100 (15%) | 6,352 | 82 | 1,666 |

---

## 5. Feature Engineering

Raw container fields are transformed into **19 engineered features** that capture the behavioral, temporal, geographic, and statistical patterns associated with high-risk shipments. These features are the core signal for the ML models.

### Feature Table

| Feature | Formula / Logic | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| **weight_diff_pct** | `abs(measured - declared) / declared × 100` | Weight discrepancies are the strongest signal for fraud. Critical containers average ~22% discrepancy vs ~3% for Clear |
| **weight_underreported** | `1` if `measured > declared × 1.2` | Detects when the actual weight significantly exceeds what was declared |
| **weight_overreported** | `1` if `declared > measured × 1.2` | Detects when declared weight is inflated to hide value-per-kg anomalies |
| **value_per_kg** | `declared_value / declared_weight` | Unusually high or low value-per-kg ratios indicate potential undervaluation or misclassification |
| **log_value** | `log(1 + declared_value)` | Log-scaled value for numerical stability in model training |
| **is_extreme_value** | `1` if `value > 99th percentile` | Flags outlier declared values based on the training distribution |
| **dwell_flag_80** | `1` if `dwell_time > 80 hours` | Extended port dwell time correlates with inspection holds or suspicious delays. Critical containers dwell ~87 hrs vs ~40 hrs for Clear |
| **dwell_flag_120** | `1` if `dwell_time > 120 hours` | Severe dwell time anomaly — strong indicator of held or problematic shipments |
| **hs_chapter** | First 2 digits of HS code | HS chapters 85, 95, 84, 90 have the highest Critical rates |
| **hs_chapter_risk** | Historical Critical rate per HS chapter | Encodes the risk profile of the commodity type being shipped |
| **hour** | Hour of declaration time | Temporal pattern — some risky shipments are filed at unusual hours |
| **is_weekend** | `1` if Saturday or Sunday | Weekend declarations may indicate attempts to avoid peak scrutiny |
| **is_off_hours** | `1` if `hour < 6` or `hour > 22` | Off-hours filings correlate with higher risk |
| **month** | Month of declaration date | Seasonal trade patterns |
| **is_high_risk_origin** | `1` if origin in `{CN, TH, KR, VN}` | ~65% of Critical containers originate from these four countries |
| **exporter_risk_score** | Historical Critical rate per exporter | Behavioral profiling — exporters with past Critical shipments are higher risk |
| **importer_risk_score** | Historical Critical rate per importer | Same behavioral profiling for the importing entity |
| **weight_value_interaction** | `weight_diff_pct × value_per_kg` | Captures the compound risk when both weight and value anomalies are present |
| **risk_origin_dwell** | `is_high_risk_origin × dwell_flag_80` | Captures the interaction between a risky origin and extended dwell time |

### Key Insights from Feature Analysis

- **Weight discrepancy** is the single strongest predictor — Critical containers have ~7× higher average discrepancy
- **Exporter behavioral profiling** captures repeat offenders (e.g., exporter `DWNJQL8` had 8 Critical shipments in the training data)
- **Geographic risk** is concentrated: China (CN), Thailand (TH), South Korea (KR), and Vietnam (VN) account for the majority of Critical shipments
- **Dwell time** acts as a real-time operational signal — containers held for extended periods at the port often have underlying issues

---

## 6. Machine Learning Models

The system uses **three complementary models** combined into a weighted ensemble. Each model captures a different aspect of risk.

### Model 1: XGBoost Classifier (Primary)

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| `n_estimators` | 300 | Sufficient trees for convergence on this dataset size |
| `max_depth` | 6 | Prevents overfitting while capturing feature interactions |
| `learning_rate` | 0.05 | Conservative learning rate for better generalization |
| `scale_pos_weight` | 77.7 | `42,347 / 545` — compensates for 78:1 class imbalance between Clear and Critical |
| `eval_metric` | mlogloss | Multi-class log-loss for training stability |

**Role**: Learns the decision boundary between Clear, Low Risk, and Critical using the 19 engineered features. Outputs `P(Critical)` — the probability that a container belongs to the Critical class.

### Model 2: Isolation Forest (Anomaly Detector)

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| `contamination` | 0.01 | Aligned with the ~1% Critical rate in the data |
| `n_estimators` | 100 | Standard for anomaly detection |
| `max_samples` | auto | Uses min(256, n_samples) per tree |
| `bootstrap` | False | Sampling without replacement for determinism |

**Role**: Identifies containers that are statistically unusual regardless of labels. Catches novel fraud patterns that XGBoost might not have seen in training.

**Training results**: 378 anomalies detected in training (1.00%), 84 in validation (1.04%), with 46 of 82 actual Critical containers flagged as anomalies (56.1% overlap).

### Model 3: Rule-Based Heuristics

A deterministic flag that fires when **any** of these conditions is true:

| Rule | Threshold | Rationale |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| Weight discrepancy > 30% | `weight_diff_pct > 30` | Extreme weight mismatch |
| Severe dwell time | `dwell_flag_120 == 1` | Container held > 120 hours |
| Extreme value-per-kg | `value_per_kg > 99th percentile` | Outlier value density |
| High-risk exporter | `exporter_risk_score > 0.05` | Exporter with > 5% Critical rate |

**Role**: Captures domain-expert knowledge that provides a safety net for cases where ML models might underweight individual extreme signals.

### Ensemble Strategy

The three models are combined into a single risk score:

```
Ensemble_Score = (0.6 × XGBoost_P(Critical) + 0.2 × IsoForest_Norm + 0.2 × Rule_Flag) × 100
```

| Component | Weight | Why |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| **XGBoost** | 60% | Highest individual accuracy; primary discriminator |
| **Isolation Forest** | 20% | Catches statistical outliers that supervised learning may miss |
| **Rule-Based** | 20% | Encodes domain knowledge and provides interpretable safety net |

**Why ensemble?** No single model is perfect. XGBoost excels at learned patterns but can miss novel anomalies. Isolation Forest detects outliers but has no concept of "Critical vs Clear." Rule-based flags capture extreme cases with certainty. The ensemble combines all three perspectives into a more robust score.

---

## 7. Risk Scoring System

### Score Calculation

Every container receives an **Ensemble Score** on a continuous 0–100 scale:

```
Score = (0.6 × P(Critical)_XGBoost + 0.2 × Normalized_IsoScore + 0.2 × Rule_Flag) × 100
```

The Isolation Forest raw score is normalized to [0, 1] using min-max scaling derived from the validation set, ensuring consistent normalization between training and inference:

```
IsoForest_Normalized = 1 − (raw_score − min_score) / (max_score − min_score)
```

### Threshold Optimization

The decision threshold for **Critical** classification was optimized by sweeping thresholds from 20 to 85 and selecting the one that maximizes the F1-score:

| Threshold | F1 Score | Recall | Precision | Critical Predictions |
|-----------|----------|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| 30 | 0.694 | 93.9% | 55.0% | 140 |
| 40 | 0.927 | 92.7% | 92.7% | 82 |
| 50 | 0.926 | 91.5% | 93.8% | 80 |
| **55** | **0.943** | **91.5%** | **97.4%** | **77** |
| 60 | 0.937 | 90.2% | 97.4% | 76 |
| 70 | 0.930 | 89.0% | 97.3% | 75 |

**Best threshold: 55** — achieves the highest F1 (0.943) with excellent precision (97.4%) while maintaining strong recall (91.5%).

### Risk Level Classification

Using the optimized threshold, every container is classified into one of three levels:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    Risk Score Scale                          │
│                                                              │
│   0 ─────────── 30 ────────────── 55 ──────────────── 100  │
│   │    Clear     │    Low Risk    │      Critical      │    │
│   │              │                │                    │    │
│   │  score < 30  │  30 ≤ score    │  score ≥ 55       │    │
│   │              │    < 55        │  (best_threshold)  │    │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

| Risk Level | Score Range | Action |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| **Clear** | 0 – 29 | No inspection needed; routine processing |
| **Low Risk** | 30 – 54 | Monitor; may warrant document review |
| **Critical** | 55 – 100 | Priority physical inspection recommended |

### Real-Time Prediction Distribution

When applied to the 8,481 real-time containers:

| Risk Level | Count | Percentage |
|------------|-------|------------|
| **Clear** | 8,287 | 97.7% |
| **Low Risk** | 122 | 1.4% |
| **Critical** | 72 | 0.8% |

This distribution is consistent with the training data (~1% Critical) and demonstrates that the model generalizes well to unseen data.

## 8. Explainable AI

### Why Explainability Matters

In regulatory and customs environments, a black-box "this container is risky" flag is insufficient. Officers need to understand **why** a container was flagged to:

- **Prioritize inspections** — a weight discrepancy flag warrants a physical weigh-in, while a value anomaly may need a document audit
- **Justify decisions** — inspections may be challenged by importers; the reasoning must be auditable
- **Build trust** — officers are more likely to act on AI recommendations they understand

### How Explanations Are Generated

The system generates a natural language `Explanation_Summary` for every container by analyzing which features contributed most to the risk score:

```
For each container:
  1. Check weight_diff_pct → "Large weight discrepancy detected (+22%)"
  2. Check value_per_kg    → "Unusual value-to-weight ratio"
  3. Check exporter_risk   → "Exporter historically linked to high-risk shipments"
  4. Check dwell_time      → "Extended dwell time at port (>80 hours)"
  5. Check origin          → "High-risk origin (CN)"
  6. Check hs_chapter_risk → "Commodity category associated with elevated risk"
  7. If no flags triggered → "No significant anomalies detected"
```

### Example Explanations

| Container | Score | Level | Explanation |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------------|
| 91475507 | 99.9 | Critical | Large weight discrepancy detected. Extended dwell time (>120 hrs). High-risk origin (CN). |
| 20889431 | 1.2 | Clear | High-risk origin (TH). |
| 41256141 | 2.5 | Clear | No significant anomalies detected. |

### Top Risk Factors Display

The dashboard presents risk factors visually with directional indicators:

```
+ Weight difference +22%        ← measured vs declared discrepancy
+ Exporter risk score high      ← historical behavioral flag
+ Value per kg anomaly          ← unusual value density
+ Dwell time > 80 hours         ← extended port stay
- Normal HS code risk           ← commodity type is not flagged
```

### Feature Impact Visualization

The `ContainerDetailModal` includes a SHAP-style horizontal bar chart showing each feature's contribution to the risk score, plus a radar chart for the risk profile across dimensions (Weight, Value, Behavior, Temporal, Geographic).

---

## 9. Backend System

The backend is built with **FastAPI** and serves as the bridge between the ML models and the frontend dashboard. Models are loaded once at startup and held in memory for fast inference.

## 12. Dashboard Analytics

The Analytics page provides visualizations that help customs authorities understand risk patterns at a strategic level.

### Visualizations

| Visualization | Library | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| **Global Risk Heatmap** | react-simple-maps | World map colored by country-level risk — darker red = higher average risk score. Hover tooltip shows country name, total containers, critical count, and risk rate |
| **Risk Timeline** | Recharts (AreaChart) | Time-series chart showing Critical, Low Risk, and Clear container counts over time |
| **Anomaly Patterns** | Recharts | Breakdown of anomaly types (weight discrepancy, value anomaly, dwell time, behavioral) with counts and average risk scores |
| **Entity Risk Panel** | Custom | Top risky exporters and importers ranked by risk score, showing critical shipment counts and total volumes |
| **Risk Distribution Donut** | Recharts (PieChart) | Proportional breakdown of Critical / Low Risk / Clear |

### Analytics Insights

These visualizations answer key strategic questions:

- **Where is risk concentrated?** → The heatmap reveals which trade corridors need more scrutiny
- **Who are the repeat offenders?** → The entity panel identifies high-risk exporters and importers
- **What types of anomalies dominate?** → The anomaly section shows whether weight fraud, value misrepresentation, or behavioral patterns are most prevalent
- **Are risk patterns changing over time?** → The timeline reveals trends and seasonal patterns

## 17. Conclusion

The **SmartContainer Risk Engine** demonstrates that AI/ML can fundamentally transform how customs authorities assess container risk. By combining supervised learning (XGBoost), unsupervised anomaly detection (Isolation Forest), and domain-expert rules into a weighted ensemble, the system achieves **91.5% recall on Critical containers with 97.4% precision** — meaning it catches the vast majority of truly risky shipments while generating very few false alarms.

### Impact Summary

| Area | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Inspection Targeting** | Random or static rules | AI-prioritized risk ranking |
| **Critical Detection** | Unknown hit rate | 91.5% of Critical containers caught |
| **False Positives** | High (broad rules flag too many) | 2.6% false positive rate on Critical |
| **Decision Transparency** | "Flagged" with no reason | Natural language explanation per container |
| **Workflow** | Paper-based, fragmented | Digital queue with notes, flags, and audit trail |
| **Monitoring** | Batch processing | Real-time container scoring as they arrive |

The system is designed to be **practical and deployable**: the FastAPI backend can be containerized and scaled, the React dashboard is production-ready, and the ML models are serialized for fast startup. Whether processing 100 containers or 10,000 in a single batch, the system delivers consistent, explainable, and actionable risk assessments.

For customs authorities, this means **fewer unnecessary inspections, faster processing of legitimate trade, and a significantly higher probability of catching the containers that actually matter**.
